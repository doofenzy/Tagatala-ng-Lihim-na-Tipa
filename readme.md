### Hearken, ye who lay hands upon this tool: though it be forged by mine own hand, I bear no burden for the deeds wrought with it. Shouldst thou wield it in folly or malice, know that thou alone shalt answer for thy transgressions. Let it be known—what mischief or crime cometh thereof, the maker shall not be held to blame. Use it wisely, or not at all, lest judgment fall upon thee, and not upon me.


# Tagatala ng Lihim na Tipa

Tagatala ng Lihim na Tipa is a script writ in the tongue of Python, which shalt awaken upon the booting of thy machine. It hideth itself within the depths of the system, though it may still be espied by keen eyes in the Task Manager. It recordeth each stroke of thy keys and inscribeth them upon a scroll of text
